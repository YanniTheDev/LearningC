# Learning C

I have finally decided to learn C so I can have a better understanding of how computers work and just generally improve my
programming skills, which I think can be done through learning C.

I will try learning **best practices** and actually learn and not just randomly memorize stuff :D.

# General Notes

### Printing

When printing:

- `%d` will print a variable of type `int`
- `%f` will print a variable of type `float`
- `%c` will print a variable of type `char`

Example:

```c
int a = 1;
float b = 2.0;
char c = 'z';

printf("%d + %f + %c", a, b, c);
```

**Note**: The variables will be filled in the order you type them in.
